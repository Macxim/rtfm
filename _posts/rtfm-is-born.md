After rebuilding my [personal website](https://macx.im) a couple of weeks ago, I
decided to revive my blog and rebuild it with something else for a change. This
allowed me to dive in the wonderful React framework that is
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). So far, the experience has been delightful: the
documentation is great, the possibilities are endless and the deployment was
super smooth. 

Reopening the blog was greatly influenced by [a
coworker](https://berislavbabic.com) who started writing on a more regular basis
again and was basically ~~nagging~~ advising me daily on the benefits of sharing my developer
experiences and writing for others in general but mostly for yourself. 

This comes at a point where I have been working at [intuo](https://intuo.io) for
almost 3 years and this last year has been rather memorable in all aspects of
life.

I was about to start it from scratch but in the end I took the decision to
include old posts for the sake of maintaining archives of my journey. In honor
of a famous acronym we often hear/say in our field, I decided to call it
[RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM).

Anyway, from now on, I will try to share some insights about my daily work and I
hope it will be useful for others as well as it is for myself. Cheers!
