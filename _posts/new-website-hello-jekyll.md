I finally had some time to work on my website. I made the decision to switch
from Wordpress to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/). The main reason
is that I wanted to learn something new. I started reading a lot of articles
about Jekyll and I thought: "Why not give it a go?".

I decided to start from scratch without migrating the previous articles. So, in
advance, sorry for the people who commented or twitted the articles but for now,
they are all dead.

As expected, building a blog with Jekyll is **easy and fast**. Even I was able
to make it work.

I also took the opportunity to *redesign* the website a bit with a new layout
and a simple logo (as you could have guessed, I'm not a designer).

For the record, I would like to remind you that this blog is [hosted on
Github](https://github.com/macxim/macxim.github.com/), and therefore
[http://macxim.github.com/](http://macxim.github.com/) redirects to
[http://maximelaforet.com](http://maximelaforet.com). Isn't it great?

Then, remember you can always [open an
issue](https://github.com/macxim/macxim.github.com/issues) if you notice
something weird.

Now it just needs some content. Let's see if I have interesting things to say...
